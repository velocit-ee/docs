# Getting Started with VME

VME installs an operating system onto a server for you — automatically, over the network. You plug in the machine, run one command, and walk away.

---

## What you need

**The seed machine** — the computer that runs VME. Usually a laptop, Raspberry Pi, or spare desktop. It needs:

- Ubuntu 22.04 or newer (Debian 12+ also works)
- A network cable connected to the same switch as your target machine
- About 15 GB of free disk space for the OS image
- An internet connection for the initial download

**The target machine** — the server you're provisioning. It needs:

- At least 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage (Proxmox VE minimum; Ubuntu Server works with less)
- A wired network card
- The ability to boot from the network — covered in step 3 below

**A network switch** connecting both machines. A basic unmanaged switch is fine.

---

## Step 1 — Install VME

On your seed machine, open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/velocit-ee/core/main/vme/install.sh | bash
```

This installs Docker, Python, downloads VME, and creates the `vme` command. It takes a few minutes and will ask for your password once.

When it finishes:

```
  VME installed successfully.

  To get started:

    cd ~/vme/vme
    vme setup
```

> **`vme` not found after install?** Close and reopen your terminal, then try again.

---

## Step 2 — Run the setup wizard

The wizard asks you a few questions and writes your config file. No YAML editing required.

```bash
cd ~/vme/vme
vme setup
```

The wizard has five steps.

---

### Step 1 of 5 — Provisioning network

VME needs to know which network port is connected to the switch your target machine is on.

```
  Detected network interfaces:

    [1]  eth0         192.168.1.50      (connected)
    [2]  eth1         no IP             (connected)

  Which interface is connected to your provisioning switch? [2]:
```

Press Enter to accept the suggestion, or type the number of the right interface. The one labelled **no IP** and **connected** is usually the right choice — it has a cable but no address yet, which is exactly what you want.

Next it asks for the seed machine's IP on that interface:

```
  Seed machine IP on this interface [192.168.100.1]:
```

The default works for most setups. Press Enter.

Then the temporary address range for target machines during provisioning:

```
  First IP to hand out to target machines [192.168.100.100]:
  Last IP in that range [192.168.100.200]:
```

Press Enter twice to accept the defaults.

**Firewall:** If you have UFW active, the wizard will detect it and offer to open the required ports automatically. Say yes.

---

### Step 2 of 5 — Target machine

```
  Which OS do you want to install?
    [1]  Proxmox VE
    [2]  Ubuntu Server
```

Choose `1` for Proxmox VE (runs virtual machines) or `2` for Ubuntu Server (general purpose Linux).

Then fill in the permanent settings for the installed machine:

| Field | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| Hostname | The machine's name on your network (e.g. `node-01`) |
| Fixed IP | Its permanent IP after provisioning — should be outside the `.100`–`.200` range, so `.10` is safe |
| Gateway | Your router's address |
| DNS server | `8.8.8.8` works everywhere |
| Install disk | The disk to wipe and install onto — `/dev/sda` for most hardware, `/dev/nvme0n1` for NVMe drives |
| Timezone | Used by the installed OS (e.g. `Europe/Berlin`) |

> **Warning:** VME wipes the install disk completely. Make sure there's nothing on it you want to keep.

---

### Step 3 of 5 — User account

The installer needs a password for the main user account even if you're using SSH keys.

```
  Password:
  Confirm:
```

The password is hashed immediately — the plaintext is never stored anywhere.

---

### Step 4 of 5 — SSH access

SSH is how you'll connect after provisioning. The wizard looks for an existing key:

```
  Found: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAA... you@machine

  Use this key? [Y/n]:
```

Press Enter to use the found key. If you don't have one yet:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Press Enter three times for defaults. Then run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and paste the output into the wizard.

---

### Step 5 of 5 — Saving config

The wizard writes `vme-config.yml` and prints next steps:

```
  Config written to vme-config.yml

  ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Setup complete.

  Next steps:
    1. Power off the target machine.
    2. Set it to network-boot (PXE) in its BIOS/UEFI settings.
    3. Run:  vme deploy
  ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Step 3 — Set the target to network boot

The target needs to load from the network before its hard drive. This is a one-time BIOS change.

Power on the target and immediately press the key your hardware uses to enter the boot menu or BIOS:

| Brand | Key |
|-------|-----|
| Dell | F12 (boot menu) or F2 (BIOS) |
| HP | F9 (boot menu) or F10 (BIOS) |
| Lenovo | F12 (boot menu) or F1 (BIOS) |
| ASRock / ASUS / MSI / Gigabyte | F11 or F8 (boot menu) or Del (BIOS) |
| Supermicro | F11 (boot menu) |

Once in the boot settings:

1. Find **Boot Order** or **Boot Priority**
2. Move **Network** or **PXE** to the top (above the hard drive)
3. Save and exit — usually F10 → Yes

Power the machine off and leave it for now.

---

## Step 4 — Deploy

```bash
vme deploy
```

VME runs a quick pre-flight check, downloads the OS image if it's not already cached, then starts the provisioning services. Once it's ready:

```
  Seed stack is running.
  Power on the target machine now.
  Watching for key events. Full logs → ~/.velocitee/logs/deploy-node-01-...log
  Press Ctrl+C to stop manually.
```

Power on your target machine. VME shows what's happening as it goes:

```
  [10:32:45]  Target discovered       MAC 00:0c:29:0a:66:5e
  [10:32:45]  DHCP lease granted      192.168.100.168
  [10:32:46]  iPXE binary delivered   via TFTP
  [10:32:47]  Boot menu loaded        via HTTP
  [10:32:47]  OS image streaming      ubuntu-24.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso
```

The install runs automatically — no interaction needed on the target machine. It typically takes 10–20 minutes. When it finishes, the target powers itself off and VME shows a summary:

```
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Provisioning complete.

  Hostname:   node-01
  IP:         192.168.100.10
  SSH user:   ubuntu
  Duration:   12m 34s
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Step 5 — Fix the boot order and connect

The target powered off after install. Before powering it back on, go back into its BIOS and move the **Hard Disk** above **Network** in the boot order — otherwise it will try to PXE boot again and loop.

Once you've done that, power it on and connect:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.100.10
```

(Use `root` instead of `ubuntu` if you installed Proxmox VE.)

---

## What next?

After provisioning completes, VME will ask:

```
  What next?
    [1]  Continue to VNE — configure networking
    [2]  Done
```

- **VNE** is the next engine in the velocit.ee stack. It configures the machine's networking. If it's installed, VME hands off to it automatically.
- **Done** closes VME and leaves a manifest file at `manifests/output/node-01-<timestamp>.json` with everything that was provisioned. You can pass this to any engine later.

---

## Other useful commands

```bash
# Download OS images ahead of time
vme images pull ubuntu-server
vme images pull proxmox-ve

# See what's cached
vme images list

# Delete a specific cached image (frees up disk space)
vme images clean proxmox-ve

# Run pre-flight checks without deploying
vme preflight

# See full compose logs during deployment (for troubleshooting)
vme deploy --verbose
```

**Reset options:**

```bash
# Stop the seed stack and clear rendered config (keeps vme-config.yml and images)
vme reset

# Also delete cached OS images (~3–8 GB freed)
vme reset --images

# Also delete vme-config.yml (you'll need to re-run vme setup)
vme reset --config-only

# Delete absolutely everything — stack, run/, config, and images
vme reset --full

# Skip the confirmation prompt (useful in scripts)
vme reset -y
```

## Troubleshooting

**The target shows "No DHCP or proxyDHCP offers were received"**
VME's DHCP server didn't respond. Check:
- `vme deploy` is still running
- Both machines are on the same switch
- The firewall allows inbound traffic on the provisioning interface. The setup wizard handles this, but if you skipped it: `sudo ufw allow in on <interface>`

**Target gets a DHCP lease but TFTP times out**
A port-specific rule for 69/udp is not enough. TFTP sends data from a random ephemeral source port, and UFW blocks the client's ACKs back to that port. The fix is a blanket interface rule:
```bash
sudo ufw allow in on <interface>
sudo ufw reload
```
The provisioning interface is isolated to your install switch, so allowing all inbound is safe.

**Pre-flight fails with "Port 69 (TFTP) is already in use"**
Another TFTP server is running. Stop it: `sudo systemctl stop tftpd-hpa`

**Pre-flight fails with "ufw is active but port 67 or 80 may be blocked"**
The setup wizard adds a blanket allow-in rule for the provisioning interface. Run it if you skipped setup: `sudo ufw allow in on <interface>`

**Target shows "No boot device" or "PXE-E53"**
Not reaching VME — check both machines are on the same switch and `vme deploy` is running.

**Pre-flight fails with "Interface not found"**
The interface name in your config doesn't match what Linux sees. Run `ip link` and update `vme-config.yml`, or re-run `vme setup`.

**Pre-flight fails with "conflicting DHCP server detected"**
Something else on the network is handing out IPs (often a router on the same switch). Use a dedicated unmanaged switch isolated from your main network.

**Boot loop after install**
The target is still booting from the network. Go into BIOS and move Hard Disk above Network in the boot order.

**apt-get hangs or Ubuntu autoinstall stalls at "Mirror configuration"**
The target machine cannot reach the internet during install. VME needs NAT enabled on the seed machine so targets can reach Ubuntu's package mirrors. The setup wizard handles this automatically, but if it was skipped or the rule was lost on reboot:
```bash
# Replace wlo1 with your internet-facing interface (check with: ip route get 8.8.8.8)
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.100.0/24 -o wlo1 -j MASQUERADE
sudo ufw route allow in on <provisioning-interface> out on wlo1
```
This takes effect immediately — no need to restart VME or the target.
